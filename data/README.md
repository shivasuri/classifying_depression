## Obtaining Data

Because this project deals with sensitive data related to mental health, all persons using it must follow protocol established by Penn's Institutional Review Board. To obtain the data, do the following:

1. Complete [CITI Training for Human Research](https://irb.upenn.edu/mission-institutional-review-board-irb/guidance/citi-training) with the Learner Group set as "Students -- Class Projects." This should take roughly 30 minutes. Send your completion report to [ccb@cis.upenn.edu](mailto:ccb@cis.upenn.edu?subject="cis530%20Final%20Homework%20-%20CITI%20Certificate").

2. Chris will send you a data agreement to sign and date.

3. Once you complete these steps, you will receive a Dropbox link to download the data. Download both files (anonymized\_user\_info\_by\_chunk.csv and shared\_task\_data.tar) to this directory.

4. Unzip the tar archive with `tar -xzvf shared_task_data.tar`.
